# SUPERCOLLIDER LEARNING RESOURCES

SuperCollider learning resources have a tendency to be spread out and sort of hidden away in hard-to-find places of the internet. 

To make the learning process easier, here is a curated compilation of the best and most useful resources out there (that are outside of the documentation).

The SuperCollider documentation also has some nice tutorials and guides that are worth checking out: [Pattern
guide](http://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#Streams-Patterns-Events%3EA-Practical-Guide), [Getting started](http://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#Tutorials%3EGetting-Started), [Live coding basics](http://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#Tutorials%3EJITLib)

There's also [the SuperCollider book published by MIT](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/supercollider-book), a great handbook for intermediate/advanced SuperCollider coding, in my opinion, but it's not a great starting point for beginners to the language.

### List of resources

[A gentle introduction to SuperCollider](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ruviaro/texts/A_Gentle_Introduction_To_SuperCollider.pdf)

A great, cohesive and very thorough e-book introducing both SuperCollider and a programmatical way of thinking about music. One of the best ways to get started with SC. 

[Eli Fieldsteel's video
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzsOOiJ_p4&list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

Great series of YouTube tutorials on a range of subjects. Really informative and pedagogically sound way of learning SuperCollider and Eli is a very knowledgable instructor.

[Thor Magnussons e-book](https://thormagnusson.gitbooks.io/scoring/content/ ) 

This is a very practical and example ridden approach to SuperCollider. 
It's full of great signal processing tricks and tips for sound design.

[Livecode SuperCollider](https://theseanco.github.io/howto_co34pt_liveCode/)

A concise guide to live coding in SuperCollider using ProxySpace, patterns
and live "patching", etc. 

[Nick Collins' SuperCollider tutorial](http://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/sctutorial/tutorial.html)

Another really good and practical SuperCollider tutorial by one of the
heavy weights of the community. Highly recommend Collins' [machine listening work too](https://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/advanced/#machinelistening)(there's a chapter in the MIT book on this).


[Fredrik Olofsson's course materials for UdK Berlin](http://redfrik.github.io/udk00-Audiovisual_Programming/)   

A real treasure trove of practical SuperCollider stuff and lots of ways to interact with other systems like Arduinos, Processing, Unity 3D, etc. 

[Faking object-oriented programming in SuperCollider with
Events](https://web.archive.org/web/20141008053015/http://www.tmroyal.com/supercollider-pseudoclasses-with-events.html)

An annoyance for many when designing object oriented projects in SuperCollider is that you
have to recompile constantly. This event-based trick is a workaround that makes your code easy to use and nice.
